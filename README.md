**Using HoppScotch.io , we can check for both the GET and POST request, which is working.**
    -->Select Method as "POST" and in Body Tab select application/json and then add the notification u want to send
        Eg:
        {
            "userId": 1,
            "message": "Hello from Hoppscotch!",
            "type": "email"
        }

        You will see an output :
        {
            "userId": 1,
            "message": "Hello from Hoppscotch!",
            "type": "email",
            "status": "sent",
            "timestamp": "2025-05-19T..."
        }

    -->Similarly to see all notifications, U can select method as "GET" and paste the link : http://localhost:3000/users/1/notifications . This will show all the notifications of User1 in the database. Same can be seen in mongoDB as well.
